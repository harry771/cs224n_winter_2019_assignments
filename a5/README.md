I copied the initial data and code skeleton from [CS224N-2019](https://github.com/Luvata/CS224N-2019). 

1e, 1f, 1g were already completed in the initial commit in the repo. I manually removed those code (though not sure if it's done correctly), so if you want to get the code skeleton you can clone from the second commit in this repo.
